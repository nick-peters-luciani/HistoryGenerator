# History Generator (In Progress)

The idea for this project is to create an application that the user can interact with to procedurarlly generate an entire world history. This would include generating a world map, simulating civilizations on a large scale, and creating lore via battles, relationships, artifacts, enemies, natural phenomena, etc.

World generation starts with creating a heightmap which defines the landmasses and oceans. Smaller bodies of water can then be added using the heightmap to create rivers that flow downhill and pool in vallies to form lakes. Next we can determine the climate which is a measure of warmth and wetness and results in several biomes such as deserts, grasslands, tropical forests, and tundras. Lastly, special resources are generated which can be either plant, animal, or mineral and will eventually be used by the civilizations we create.

Once the world is created, the civilizations can be added. Each will be unique having its own personality, government, and used resources. The personality or characteristics of a civilization will determine how it interacts with the environment and other civilizations as well as its own people.

With the world and civilizations generated the simulation can then take place. By looking at a cvilization’s characteristics and the state of the world we can determine which actions its more likely to take. This would include things such as gathering resources, expanding, declaring war, or forming a union. Outside of a civilization’s control, natural events could occur that may aid or hinder their motives.

The hope is that after doing all of this we should be able to log the progression of history based on the events that occur over time and spit out an interesting story of a unique world.
